<h1 id="top"> On-Boarding</h1>

**IN** this document we will list each process and what will be needed to on-board<br>
Each on-boarding experience is broken down into 3 parts:
* Order Entry

---

Each of these parts may be different depending on the <u>level of commitment</u>.<br>
There are three <u>levels of commitment</u>:
* [Single Order](#single)

### Order Entry

* Styles | Designs | Quantity | Roster *(if applicable)* | Shipping Details


### Product Design

1) Art assets are delivered to [customerservice@fullgear.com](mailto:customerservice@fullgear.com)

**THIS** <u>level of commitment</u> is available to any business that can commit **X** amount of unit-sales a month. Client will work with representatives to select **X** products the client will offer their customers.
### Order Entry

Orders may be placed in 1 of 2 ways:
1) Orders are collected by the client in a CSV file and delivered to [customerservice@fullgear.com](mailto:customerservice@fullgear.com) on a weekly or bi-weekly schedule.
2) If the client is using a E-Commerce platform, such as Woo Commerce or Shopify, the client may be eligible to have their online store integrated with our production facility so as the client's customers purchase from the client's store it will seamlessly transfer the order details and put it into production. This option is available for no-customization or name/number customization products. To Learn how to setup products in an E-Commerce store and integrate with Full Gear follow this [link](https://bodaly.github.io/Integration_ReadMe.html).

### Product Design
#### Who Designs the Product?
The client may decide between two options:

**Stock Design:** Client may choose out of our extensive collection of stock designs that can be used at no additional cost to the client.

**Full Custom:** The design will be primarily the resposibilty of the client. Full Gear can assist with creation of product design at a *premium* of **X**. Full Gear will provide the following upon request to facilitate the client doing all necessary artwork.
* Mockup Templates
	* Full Gear Mockup templates are Adobe Illustrator files and are actual size of the MD Garment.
	* All Mockup Templates are housed [here](https://groupestahl-my.sharepoint.com/:f:/g/personal/odalyb_fullgear_com/EqhDcIKVEzVBjIOeZxdFobgB-1JvblbktAG1RVD98PZZ-Q?e=fReu3j) sorted by style. If the desired style is not available please send a request to [customerservice@fullgear.com](mailto:customerservice@fullgear.com) and allow at least 24hrs for it to show up in the selection.
* Illustrator Swatch Library with Full Gear Standard Athletic Colors.
	* These colors as they are given in the swatches guarantee that the colors are consistent.
	* We cannot guarantee accuracy of custom colors unless a color match is requested at a *premium* of **X**.


<header><h4 style="display:inline-block;"> How to Send Designs for Production</h4><span><i> (Full Custom Only)</i></span></header>

All product designs must be rolled out on what is called an **Art Production Template** (**APT**). This is done by applying all assets from the mockup to the **APT** on all sizes.

**APT**s will be delivered by way of [the APT Portal](bodaly.github.io/aptportal.html). The client's Full Gear representative will deliver the login information once the **APT**s are available.
Notes regarding **APT**s:
* All **APT**s are Adobe Illustrator files.
* Once finished all Art Production Files should be saved as PDFs with high-quality print settings.
* The Guidelines of the template are pre-nested for efficient printing.
* The Lines of the template must remain in the orientation and position they are given.
* We recommend all elements be Vector Graphics though Raster Images are allowed and should be at least 100 ppi.
* All Artwork should be Cropped inside the Red Bleed Lines.
* Alignment on curves will likely not come out as desired. Best to avoid.
* Instructions in [the APT Portal](bodaly.github.io/aptportal.html) should be read before working on the **APT**s.


### Delivery

All product will be delivered directly to the end customer unless specifically requested to be different.
